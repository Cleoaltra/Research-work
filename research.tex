\section{\textbf{Introduction}}
The purpose of this study was to conduct a survey on were different young people especially campus students hangout from.
Young people have many different kinds of friends. There are casual acquaintances, associates, classmates, school friends, friends from camp or church or dance or soccer, all with varying and shifting degrees of closeness.
Young people(the youth "") today have a lot of free time. Do they use their free time wisely? Or do many of them just waste it doing pointless activities. In my opinion, different people use free time to visit there their favorite hangouts and get involved in different activities.
\setlength{\parindent}{10ex}Of course, many young people, just like many old people,waste their time. Some youngsters choose to sleep instead of getting up and being active, others are more active, but prefer to spend all their time in the mall or in the coffee shop, just watching girls or chatting with their friends.Others still never leave their rooms and just sit around chatting on the internet or watching sports,movies,soaps,series on television or even listen to music.\textit{"Its a lot easier to just sit and talk about your team,that's what many people prefer to do."}.
However,most young people are trying to create a good future for themselves hence do extra courses or spend their time reading thus hanging out in classes all the time.\par

\section{\textbf{Place of Hangout}}
People will go for hangout with their friends,relatives,alone or colleagues and the places they choose may differ between one and another.\par This survey was followed by 12 students,asked questions regarding the place of  hangout,their main interests when they go to the place and how often they go to the place. From the 12 respondents,15 respondents like going out for hangout. Most respondents following this survey are those who are around (19-24) years of age, moreover the proportion of men exceeds women,thus more men like going out for hangout than men.
\begin{center} Most respondents when with relatives like going to the mall (restaurant,cafe), the beach and when with friends they like going to the club, or just hangout in rooms. Then those that go by themselves do sports (basketball, golf).
\end{center}
Most of the respondents go out on Friday,Saturday and Sunday, but the male respondents have a tendency to go out for longer time than the female respondents.

\section{\textbf{Conclusion}}
  Places (including high streets, street markets, shopping precincts, community centers, parks, playgrounds, and neighborhood spaces in residential areas) play a vital role in the social life of communities.  They act as a ‘self-organizing public service’, a shared resource in which experiences and value are created.
 \par Places offer many benefits: the ‘feel-good’ buzz from being part of a busy street scene; the therapeutic benefits of quiet time spent on a park bench; places where people can display their culture and identities and learn awareness of diversity and difference; opportunities for children and young people to meet, play or simply ‘hang out’.  All have important benefits and help to create local attachments, which are at the heart of a sense of community.

Every person needs a support system that consists of either colleagues, friends, relatives, or direct family members. It is crucial to have a support system that consists of the right people. They can offer you either emotional, moral, spiritual.Hanging out reduces stress.
